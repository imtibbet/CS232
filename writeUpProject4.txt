Writeup

Create a wiki page with your writeup. For each task, write a short description of the task, in your own words.

Include a description of your top-level design.


Include the two programs you wrote using the simple instruction set.
I can put the source code in when we transfer this to the wiki.

Include a picture of your circuit in simulation.
Done, already in the wiki.

Describe the hardware testing you undertook to prove the circuit works.
We ran it and verified that the program described by the lightrom corresponded to the lights on the board for the lights, the IR and the PC.

Include a description, and pictures, of any extensions.

Extensions

Make longer programs.
Add instructions to the system. Make branch instructions, for example.
Add a hold/free button to the display.
Add a button that lets you speed up or slow down the display.
Be creative.

Project 4: Programmable Lights

We created a programmable light display using VHDL that can use up to 16 instruction codes and 64 total instructions. It uses the 8 green LED lights as the display and the 10 red LED lights to show what the state machine driving the programmable display is doing. The state machine is our top level design with an instance of lightrom, which specifies the program that will run as the top level increments.
